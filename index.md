Yi Zhang is a Research Fellow at the [Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute][DFCI] and [Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health][HSPH]. I joined [Dr. X. Shirley Liu][LiuLab]'s lab in July 2019 and also co-mentored by [Dr. Myles Brown][MylesLab] and [Dr. Xihong Lin][LinLab]. I did my PhD in Bioengineering in [Dr. Jun S. Song][SongLab]'s group at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][UIUC] working for NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) U54 center.

## Research Interests

I have developed computational biology and statistical learning methods to decipher human genetic variants associated with cancer risk. I have also been developing machine learning methods for single-cell genomics data to understand cells in tumor. I also enjoy working on patient genomics data to understand disease and identify therapeutic targets. Our collaborators include Dr. Catherine J. Wu at DFCI and Dr. David E. Fisher at MGH. My research interests are to develop statistical and machine learning methods for data-driven discoveries in biomedicine. For fun, I enjoy hiking, music and wildlife photography.

**I'll join Duke University in Jan 2024 as an Assistant Professor in Department of Neurosurgery, and Department of Bioinformatics & Biostatistics.
