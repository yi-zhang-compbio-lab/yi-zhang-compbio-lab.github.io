##### Yi Zhang, PhD
I'm an Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Medicine in the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. I obtained BS from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and PhD in Bioengineering with Dr. Jun S. Song at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I did postdoc at Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University School of Public Health mentored by Shirley Liu, Myles Brown, and Xihong Lin. I have been developing integrative genomic methods to identify functional gene regulatory mechanisms behind disease-associated human genetic variants. I have also recently been developing machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods that leverage large-scale single-cell datasets to understand cell states in tumor microenvironment. My ongoing work include deep learning models of high-resolution spatial transcriptomics, computational pathology, and statistical models for genetics and functional genomics. For fun, I enjoy hiking, music and wildlife photography.

##### Zijia Tang

My name is Zijia (Thomas) Tang, and I am a undergraduate research intern in Yi’s lab starting June 2024, majoring in Computer Science.  My research interests lie in computational biology and machine learning. Previously, I delved into single-cell perturbation, employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to predict cellular responses to perturbations. I’m eager to increase the interpretability of my previous work and learn ways to combine privileged information and new information found by neural networks. In my free time, I enjoy playing drums, exercising, and reading science fiction.
