##### Yi Zhang, PhD
I'm an Assistant Professor at Duke University School of Medicine in the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. I obtained BS from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and PhD in Bioengineering with Dr. Jun S. Song at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I joined Dr. X. Shirley Liuâ€™s lab for postdoc and with co-mentors Dr. Myles Brown and Dr. Xihong Lin, at Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University School of Public Health. I have been developing integrative genomic methods to identify functional gene regulatory mechanisms behind disease-associated human genetic variants. I have also recently been developing machine learning methods that leverage large-scale single-cell datasets to understand cell states in tumor microenvironment. My ongoing work include deep learning modeling of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and statistical models that combines statistical genetics and functional genomics. For fun, I enjoy running, hiking, music and wildlife photography.
